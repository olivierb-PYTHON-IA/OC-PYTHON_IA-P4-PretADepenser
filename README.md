# OC-PYTHON_IA-P4-PretADepenser

The goal of this project is to put in place a Credit Scoring Algorithm (Supervised Classification) using the Home Credit Default Risk dataset.

Project 4 - Pret A Depenser :
- Main Topic : Supervised Models - Classification - Credit Scoring Model 
- Dataset : Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk
- New Python Packages : SciKit Learn / Imblearn / SHAP
- New Concepts : Imbalanced Data / Classification Models / Features Engineering / Pipelines / Models Selection / Hyper Parameters Optimization / Performances Evaluation / Models Interpretation
- Supervised Models : 
   + Linear models : Logistic Regression / SGD Classifier (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
   + Non linear models : SVC with different kernels (Support Vector Classifier) 
   + Ensemble models : Random Forest Classifier / Adaboost / HistGradientBoosting
